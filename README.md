# budongsanbuddy
Backend site for budongsan proprietors to upload featured properties

TO DO: (PRIORITY:: greatest *** -> * least )

-front end **
-Account Create Success Screen **
-Logout optimization *
-clean up submit_site and login views (especially the latter) *
-Images are stored locally which is a crummy solution because it is broken. Get this on an S3 ***
-Migrate the db to a MySQL ***
-Build a backend API that dumps backend data into json for parsing ***
-TESTS TESTS TESTS **
-FIX IMAGES.



Things I am not happy about:

- The Auth system is kinda crap, fix this
- Var naming is not consistent, go back in sublime on the desktop and fix this
- Most of the Variable names are shit
- pull out that helper function from the submit_site views.py ASAP.
-
